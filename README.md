# Psychiatric, A&E, and Cardiovascular Assessments Calculators
_These are mostly GNU/Linux [BASH Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), AWK, [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), Sed & [MS-PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/) calculator scripts for cognitive tests, psychiatric rating scales, cardiovascular calculators. Some calculators are platform independent (Perl, [REXX](https://www.rexxla.org/), [FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/), and other Batch files for [FreeDOS](https://www.freedos.org/)_. _Some scripts are designed for GNU/Linux and other POSIX compatible OS, others are geared to MS-PowerShell, and some others eg platform independent eg Perl._ 

# Rationale
Medical calculators help provide numerical values which makes quantification, and tracking of progress easier. Medicine is not a pure scientific endeavour, hence, some medical calculators esp. measuring depression severity etc. attempt to put a numerical value to a subjective experience. At present, there are available calculators online however, they do not cover every thing. They tend to require GUI, online connection, and modern web-browser. The aim of these calculators and algorithms is to provide a simple minimalist effecient command-line interface (CLI) scripts which could work in a shell, or terminal. These tests do not require GUI or online connection (*apart from downloading them*). The current scripts aim to cover multiple platforms eg \*nix (Unix, BSD, GNU/Linux), \*nix/BSD derivatives eg MacOS, platforms that have POSIX compliance layer eg [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/), as well as other operating systems eg FreeDOS & MS-Windows, as well as other platform independent calculators and algorithms. Also, users have access to the source code, so they are welcome to study, improve, and copy the design for other tests under GNU/GPL-3 license.

# Coding Principles
The general guiding concept is that these codes offer more than just a calculator. They print a report that could be copied from a terminal, or could be saved to a file. They calculate subscores, and they have data validation for each parameter with loops to guard against accidental typos. Also, in case of subscores, there are `if` statements to make sure that the score entered is logical eg. in ACE-III if someone scores 4/5 in orientation in time. The test will ask about score for Mini-ACE which is out of 4. Logically, the result could be only 4 or 3. If the ACE-III orientation in time score is 1, the Mini-ACE would only be 1 or 0. The code makes sure that the results are coherent in that sense. The same principle guides registration & recall; one cannot recall, what one did not register. `while` loops ensure that values entered are within the accepted range only to minimise the GIGO effect.

### Dependencies
The shell scripts with `-bc` in their names require basic calculator `bc`. Most GNU/Lnux distros would ship with `bc` including Haiku bash terminal. The shell scripts with -calc in their names require `calc` calculator. The shell scripts with -echo in their names calculate via `echo` command. `-echo` files are the most basic, possibly all of the aforementioned operating systems have and distros would ship with `echo` command, `bc` is the most popular calculator, and `calc` might not be available by default. So, user may want to check dependencies, or use the version that suits them. Each version operates more or less identical two others. It is recommended to use `-bc.sh` files first for calculators as they are the most updated and they could have converters to MMSE also.

## Instructions to use AWK scripts
- AWK works under Unix, GNU/Linux, BSD. MacOS-X, Haiku. Either on TTY or terminal type `awk -f filename.awk` and the programme will be executed
- `cdr.awk` & `cdr-fltd.awk` have more strict data validation than their MS-PowerShell counterparts `cdr-pwsh.ps1` & `cdr-fltd-pwsh.ps1`
- ECT charge & age-based calculators in AWK work better than BASH shell coutnerpart scripts. ECT Charge uses `IGNORECASE` which is typical of GNU/AWK (gAWK), if used under a different non-GNU platform consider adding `#` and space before it to comment it out. The rest of the script should not be affected.
- `qtc.awk` is more accurate and provide more data than `qtc.bas`

## Twin Project
[Python ACE-III Calculator](https://github.com/moftasa/PythonACEIIICalculator) is a twin project by [Mostafa Hussein Omar](https://github.com/moftasa) that has both a LibreOffice spreadsheet (\*.ods) that could be filled with an automatic calculator and a Python script that works as a calculator. Type `Python` and the path of the script and it will start.

## HOWTO
- To clone (copy the assessments) if you have git. You can type `git clone https://github.com/E-Sid/scripts/`
- To Download hover of the icon `code <>` and download zip file (compressed file). Then unzip it either via GUI or `unzip` command on the CLI
- You can also copy a single code and paste it as a text file then rename it with the appropriate extension, and make it executable.

## Disclaimer
- For cardiovascular calculators: Mean arterial blood pressure, QTc interval calculator, Cardiac output offer only one way of calculation and should be used for general guidance **ONLY**. Please note that this codes here are just examples, calculations should **ONLY** be performed by trained healthcare professionals. The formulae used here is just an estimate and the actual cardiovascular calculations can vary based on individual factors such as fitness level and health conditions. 
- For psychiatric calculators, the interpretations of severity is not added as the score **SHOULD NOT** be interpreted as a marker of severity of illness in isolation from a clinical context. These are **NOT** substitutes to assessment by a health care professional.
- All these scripts are **ONLY** calculators not the tests themselves. Usage of these score calculators is both free (libre) & free (gratis) under GNU/GPL 3.0 however, the usage of any of the test material is subject to the authors copyright status.
- For diagnostic algorithms the source of information eg [mhGAP](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549790) should **ALWAYS** be checked. This is aimed at healthcare professionals, and should be used **ONLY** to facilitate the algorithmic part of the diagnostic procedure, but **NOT** as a substitute for clinical assessment, or the WHO mhGAP guidance.
- Some shorter Perl codes were translated from AWK code via `a2p` command eg `mhgap-dementia.pl`. The code is the result of this conversion approach, but it is functional, more recent codes eg `ace.pl`, `acer.pl`, `mace.pl`, `mhr.pl` were written directly in Perl. Currently, the ability to save the results is being added gradually to `Perl` codes. The first one to utilise this is `celsius.pl`.
- `ace.pl` & `acer.pl` use the deprecated goto for saving results. In case, the a new version appears, one can use `ace-nosave.pl` instead.
